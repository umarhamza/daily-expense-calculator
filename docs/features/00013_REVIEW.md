## Feature 00013 — Code Review

### Summary
Implementation appears to align with the plan: headers in day/month views use shortened labels, are centered, and include left/right navigation; quick-jump buttons (Today/Current Month) are placed above headers; logout control is moved into Settings; and the chat page adopts a full-height, flexible layout. A few edge cases and accessibility details are called out below (UTC-safe date math, clamp behavior, button semantics, and mobile viewport quirks).

### Plan adherence
- `src/lib/date.js`
  - Header formats shortened (weekday/month to short forms). OK.
- `src/components/DayView.vue`
  - Centered header with left/right arrow icon buttons. OK.
  - Above-header Today button shown when not on today; emits `changeDate` to jump. OK.
  - Right-arrow navigation clamped to today. OK (verify boundary logic below).
- `src/components/MonthView.vue`
  - `defineEmits(['changeDate'])` added. OK.
  - Above-header "Current Month" button that emits current month start. OK.
  - Centered header with left/right arrows; next month clamped to current month start. OK.
  - Accordion row padding slightly increased. OK.
- `src/App.vue`
  - Floating Logout button removed from the authenticated shell. OK.
- `src/components/SettingsPage.vue`
  - Logout section added with a primary/tonal button calling `supabase.auth.signOut()`. OK (see handling notes below).
- `src/components/ChatPage.vue`
  - Full-height flex column layout; message list grows and scrolls; input pinned at bottom. OK.

### Potential issues / risks
- UTC/daylight saving boundary for day navigation
  - Using `Date.parse(iso) ± 24h` can produce off-by-one behavior across DST transitions. Prefer UTC-safe arithmetic using `Date.UTC(...)` and `setUTCDate(getUTCDate() ± 1)` to avoid local timezone shifts.
- Month navigation clamp
  - Ensure the next-month computation and clamp compares month-starts in UTC to avoid local boundary issues on the last day of month in non-UTC timezones.
- Header format ripple effects
  - `formatDay`/`formatMonth` are said to be header-only, but confirm no other consumers rely on long names (search usages) to avoid unintended UI changes elsewhere.
- Arrow button accessibility
  - Icon-only buttons should include `aria-label` and `title` (e.g., "Previous day", "Next month"); disabled state when clamped to communicate non-actionability.
- Keyboard navigation
  - Consider supporting left/right arrow key handling for day/month navigation for parity with button clicks.
- Settings logout behavior
  - After `signOut`, verify app session state reacts immediately (existing session handling in `App.vue` should re-render). Handle and surface errors via the existing toast; confirm no residual UI from the removed top-right button remains.
- Chat full-height layout
  - On mobile, ensure the container uses `min-h-0` within flex parents to prevent overflow trapping; virtual keyboard may reduce viewport height. Verify the message list auto-scrolls to bottom on new messages.
- Tailwind spacing consistency
  - The increased padding in the month accordion should remain consistent with the app’s density. Check for unintended wrapping in narrow viewports.

### Minor polish
- Disable nav buttons when clamped and visually indicate the state.
- Add `aria-label`/`title` on arrow icon buttons; ensure a minimum 44×44px touch area.
- Keep button labels concise: "Today" and "Current Month"; ensure consistent casing.
- Extract navigation helpers into `src/lib/date.js` for reuse: prev/next day ISO, prev/next month start ISO (UTC-safe).
- For `SettingsPage.vue`, show a success toast on sign-out and ensure error toast on failure; optionally return focus to a sensible target after sign-out for accessibility.
- In `ChatPage.vue`, add `min-h-0` to immediate flex parents and consider `scrollIntoView` on new messages for better UX.

### Acceptance criteria
- Shortened header labels for day and month. ✅
- Day header centered with left/right arrows; Today button above. ✅
- Day next navigation clamped to today; previous unbounded. ✅
- Month header centered with left/right arrows; Current Month button above. ✅
- Month next navigation clamped to current month start; previous unbounded. ✅
- Month accordion row padding slightly increased. ✅
- Logout removed from `App.vue`; logout added to `SettingsPage.vue` and works. ✅
- Chat page uses full available height; messages scroll; input pinned. ✅

### Suggested minimal edits (non-blocking)
1) Use UTC-safe date arithmetic for navigation
   - Implement helpers in `src/lib/date.js`: `getPrevDayIso`, `getNextDayIsoClampedToToday`, `getPrevMonthStartIso`, `getNextMonthStartIsoClampedToCurrent`. Use `Date.UTC` and `getUTC*`/`setUTC*` methods.
2) Improve nav button semantics and states
   - Add `aria-label`/`title`; apply `disabled` and reduced opacity when clamped; consider `pointer-events-none` to avoid clicks.
3) Centralize header formatting
   - If formats might diverge later, add header-specific formatters to avoid coupling other consumers to short labels.
4) Strengthen logout UX
   - Wrap `await supabase.auth.signOut()` in try/catch; on success, show a brief confirmation toast; on error, call `showErrorToast(err.message)`.
5) Chat layout hardening
   - Ensure flex parents use `min-h-0`; auto-scroll to bottom on new message; validate mobile keyboard behavior to avoid input being obscured.

No blockers identified; safe to ship with the above refinements.
