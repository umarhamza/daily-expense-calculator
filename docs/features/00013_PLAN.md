## 00013 - Header tweaks, navigation arrows, today/month buttons, logout move, chat height

### Context
Requested UI adjustments across day/month pages, settings, and chat:
- "Shorten the day and month names at the top of the day and month pages. Center the entire dates and add arrows to the right and left of them."
- "Move the today button above the date. And also add month button to the month page above the dates which will return to current month."
- "Add a little more padding to the accordion items on the month page"
- "Move the logout button to the settings page"
- "Make the chat component on the chat page full height."

### Scope of Changes
- Visual/structural updates to headers, navigation controls, and layout in `DayView`, `MonthView`, and `ChatPage`.
- Relocation of logout control from app root to `SettingsPage`.
- Minor spacing tweak to month accordion rows.
- Keep data and Supabase logic unchanged.

### Files To Change / Create
- Change: `src/lib/date.js`
  - Update formatting used for the page headers to use shortened names:
    - `formatDay(isoDate)`: switch to `weekday: 'short'`, `month: 'short'` while retaining `day` and `year`.
    - `formatMonth(isoMonthStart)`: switch to `month: 'short'`, keep `year: 'numeric'`.
  - Note: These are only used by `DayView` and `MonthView` headers today; safe to adjust in place. If broader usage appears, we can introduce new header-specific helpers instead.

- Change: `src/components/DayView.vue`
  - Header: center the date string and add left/right arrow icon buttons flanking it.
    - Left arrow: emit `changeDate` with previous ISO day.
    - Right arrow: emit `changeDate` with next ISO day, clamped to today (do not advance beyond today).
  - Move the "Today" button above the centered date header (e.g., a small text button aligned to the right in a row above the header). Keep current logic to hide it when already on today.

- Change: `src/components/MonthView.vue`
  - Add emits: `defineEmits(['changeDate'])` to align with parent expectation already wired in `src/App.vue`.
  - Add a small "Current Month" button above the month header that emits `changeDate` with the current month start (`YYYY-MM-01`).
  - Header: center the month label and add left/right arrow icon buttons flanking it.
    - Left arrow: emit `changeDate` with previous month start.
    - Right arrow: emit `changeDate` with next month start, clamped to the current month (do not advance beyond the current calendar month).
  - Accordion rows padding: increase a bit (e.g., list item from `px-3 py-2` to `px-4 py-3`).

- Change: `src/App.vue`
  - Remove the fixed top-right "Logout" button from the authenticated shell. No other behavior changes.

- Change: `src/components/SettingsPage.vue`
  - Add a "Logout" section at the bottom with a primary/tonal `v-btn` that signs out the user.
    - Import `supabase` and implement `async function logout() { await supabase.auth.signOut() }`.
    - Optionally show a brief confirmation toast using the existing toast system; errors should be surfaced with `showErrorToast`.

- Change: `src/components/ChatPage.vue`
  - Make the chat page full height within the app content area:
    - Use a flex column layout for the page container.
    - Make the messages container flex-grow with `overflow-y: auto`; remove the hard `max-height: 60vh` constraint.
    - Keep the input row pinned at the bottom (non-growing) so the message list uses available vertical space.

### Behavior & Algorithms
- Day navigation
  - Previous day: `Date.parse(iso) - 24h` → ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`.
  - Next day: `Date.parse(iso) + 24h`, clamp to today.

- Month navigation
  - Previous month start: year/month arithmetic with `UTC` safe constructor → `YYYY-MM-01`.
  - Next month start: same arithmetic; clamp to the current calendar month start.

- Emitting dates
  - Both `DayView` and `MonthView` continue to emit `changeDate` with an ISO date string. Parent `src/App.vue` already handles this and updates `selectedDate` / computed `monthOfSelected` accordingly.

### UI/UX Notes
- Centered headers with arrows provide consistent affordance in both day and month views.
- "Today" and "Current Month" buttons sit above headers for quick jump actions.
- Slightly increased padding in the month accordion improves readability without changing density site-wide.
- Logout action belongs in Settings; removing the floating logout avoids accidental taps.
- Full-height chat improves usability for longer conversations and smaller screens.

### Implementation Steps
1. Update `src/lib/date.js` to shorten `formatDay` and `formatMonth` outputs.
2. In `src/components/DayView.vue`:
   - Rework header layout to a centered title with left/right arrows; wire clicks to emit `changeDate` prev/next (with today clamp on next).
   - Move the existing Today button into a small row above the header.
3. In `src/components/MonthView.vue`:
   - Add `defineEmits(['changeDate'])`.
   - Add a small "Current Month" button row above the header.
   - Center the header and add left/right arrows; wire to prev/next month computations with clamp to current month.
   - Increase list item padding inside the expanded accordion.
4. In `src/App.vue`, delete the floating Logout button.
5. In `src/components/SettingsPage.vue`, add a Logout section with a sign-out button using `supabase.auth.signOut()`.
6. In `src/components/ChatPage.vue`, convert to a full-height flex column layout; make the messages container grow and scroll.
7. Build and run locally to verify:
   - Headers show short names, are centered, and arrows navigate as expected.
   - Today/Current Month buttons jump appropriately.
   - Month accordion spacing increased.
   - Logout only in Settings and works.
   - Chat uses full available height and scrolls.

### Out of Scope
- Introducing routing or global layout changes.
- Persisting UI state (e.g., expanded accordions) across sessions.
- Localization beyond the updated short formats.
