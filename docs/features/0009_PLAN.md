## Make Install App mobile-only; remove desktop prompts

Brief: The install app functionality is for mobile not desktop. Update the PWA install experience so the CTA only appears on supported mobile browsers (e.g., Android Chrome) and never on desktop. Provide iOS guidance where BIP is unavailable. Do not change PWA registration or manifest.

### Scope
- Hide/disable the Install button on desktop entirely; no desktop encouragement text.
- Show Install button only on mobile when `beforeinstallprompt` (BIP) fires.
- On iOS Safari (no BIP), show a short inline tip to use “Add to Home Screen”, not a button.
- Keep success toast and `installed` emit intact.

### Affected files and updates

1) PWA install component
- File: `src/components/PwaInstall.vue`
  - Add a mobile detection guard (lightweight UA regex or feature-based check) and set `isMobile` ref on mount.
  - Only attach `beforeinstallprompt`/`appinstalled` listeners when `isMobile` and not already standalone.
  - Gate the Install button rendering behind `isMobile` and `canInstall`.
  - Replace the current generic info message to avoid suggesting desktop. Update to:
    - Android (no BIP yet): “Install not available yet in this browser. Try again later.”
    - iOS Safari: “On iOS, use Share → Add to Home Screen.”
  - Do not render any CTA on desktop. If running in standalone, keep the “App is installed” success alert.

2) Settings page
- File: `src/components/SettingsPage.vue`
  - No structural changes. The embedded `<PwaInstall />` will inherit the new mobile-only behavior.

3) PWA config
- File: `vite.config.js`
  - No changes. Manifest/workbox remain as-is.

### Step-by-step implementation
1. Add `isMobile` detection in `PwaInstall.vue` (e.g., `/Mobi|Android|iPhone|iPad|iPod/i.test(navigator.userAgent)`), set on mount.
2. Conditionally register `beforeinstallprompt` and `appinstalled` event listeners only if `isMobile` and not `isStandalone`.
3. Update template:
   - If `isStandalone`: show success alert (unchanged).
   - Else if `isMobile` and `canInstall`: show primary Install button.
   - Else if `isMobile` and no BIP:
     - If iOS Safari detected: show inline tip for Add to Home Screen.
     - Otherwise: show small caption that install is not currently available.
   - Else (desktop): render nothing for install CTA (no button, no desktop hint).
4. Adjust `infoMessage` logic to remove desktop suggestions and tailor messages per platform.
5. Verify no imports/usages elsewhere assume desktop install.

### Risks and considerations
- UA detection can be imperfect; keep the logic minimal and defensive.
- iOS Add to Home Screen flows vary slightly across versions; keep guidance generic.
- Some desktop environments technically support PWA install; requirement explicitly disables desktop CTA.

### Acceptance criteria
- Desktop browsers show no Install button or install guidance; if already in standalone, “App is installed” alert still appears.
- Android Chrome on mobile shows Install button when BIP fires and installs successfully.
- iOS Safari on mobile shows a concise Add to Home Screen tip, not a button.
- Success toast and `installed` event continue to work on successful installs.
