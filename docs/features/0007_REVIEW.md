## 0007 Review — Add Quantity to Expenses (UI, DB Migration, Chat/Gemini)

### 1) Plan implementation status
- AddExpenseModal.vue: Quantity numeric input added with default 1, integer ≥ 1 validation, and included in emitted payload `{ item, cost, quantity, date }`.
- EditExpenseModal.vue: Quantity input added, pre-populated from `expense.quantity` with fallback to 1; included in Save emit.
- DayView.vue: When saving edits, passes `quantity` to `updateExpense`; item rows display `×N` when `quantity > 1`.
- MonthView.vue: Per-row rendering shows `×N` when `quantity > 1`. Grouping derives base item from name by trimming trailing `xN`/`×N`, which maintains compatibility with legacy items; explicit `quantity` is displayed when present.
- src/lib/supabase.js: All selects include `quantity`. `insertExpense` coerces and persists `quantity` (defaults to 1 if invalid or missing). `updateExpense` supports `quantity` updates with coercion and guard to ≥ 1.
- DB migration: `supabase/migrations/20250827160000_expenses_add_quantity.sql` adds `quantity integer not null default 1 check (quantity >= 1)`; backfills from legacy suffixes and normalizes `item` by removing trailing `xN`/`×N`.
- netlify/functions/chat.js: Gemini add flow (`tryAddFromNaturalText`) extracts `{ name, quantity, unitPrice, total }`, inserts rows as `{ item: name, quantity, cost: total, date }`, and includes `quantity` in selects used by chat queries.

Conclusion: The plan appears implemented across UI, data layer, migration, and chat integration.

### 2) Obvious bugs or issues
- None blocking identified during review. Inputs coerce/validate `quantity`, library defaults to 1 on bad input, and UI displays `×N` only when `> 1`.

### 3) Data alignment checks
- Shapes are flat with snake_case in DB access (`item,cost,quantity,date`). UI components pass numeric `quantity` to lib; lib selects include `quantity` consistently for Day and Month views and chat queries.
- Backfill logic in migration safely derives `quantity` from legacy suffix and removes it from `item`, aligning with the new explicit column.

### 4) Over-engineering / file size
- Changes are minimal and align with existing patterns. No unnecessary abstractions introduced.

### 5) Style/syntax consistency
- Matches repo rules: Vue 3 `<script setup>`, centralized Supabase access in `src/lib/supabase.js`, early returns, and explicit named exports in libs.

### Actionable follow-ups
1. Consider adding client-side clamping on `v-text-field` for quantity to reject non-integer input instantly (currently coerced on save). Optional.
2. Consider updating any analytics/summary views to leverage explicit `quantity` in future features (non-blocking, outside current scope).

### Verification checklist
- UI add/edit:
  - Add dialog shows Quantity with default 1; prevents save when quantity <= 0.
  - Edit dialog pre-populates quantity; saving updates row with new quantity.
- Day/Month views:
  - Rows show `×N` when quantity > 1.
  - Totals continue to sum `cost` only.
- Data layer:
  - `fetchExpensesByDate`/`fetchExpensesByMonth` return `quantity`.
  - `insertExpense`/`updateExpense` persist and return `quantity`.
- DB:
  - Migration adds `quantity` with default and check constraint; legacy suffixes are backfilled and stripped.
- Chat:
  - `tryAddFromNaturalText` stores base item names, explicit quantity, and sets `cost = total`.

### Risks / notes
- User-provided quantity via number inputs can still be non-integer via manual edits; coercion guards handle it, but UI clamping could further reduce surprises.

### Verdict
- Plan implemented correctly across layers. No blocking issues; optional UX tightening suggested for quantity input clamping.
