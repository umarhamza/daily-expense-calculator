## 00012 - Improve Sign In / Sign Up Page Design

### Context
The current authentication UI in `src/components/AuthForm.vue` uses basic inputs and a single primary action. The request is to improve the visual design and affordances of the sign in and sign up experiences, ensuring clear, appropriate buttons and a polished first impression.

Verbatim user note: "please improve the design of the sign in and sign up pages make sure they have appropriate buttons and I start nicely"

### Scope of Changes
- Visual and interaction updates to the authentication screen only.
- No change to authentication logic or backend. Supabase auth calls remain functionally the same.
- Maintain current application flow in `src/App.vue` where unauthenticated users see the auth screen.

### Files To Change / Create
- Change: `src/components/AuthForm.vue`
  - Convert to Vuetify components (`v-card`, `v-text-field`, `v-btn`, `v-alert`).
  - Improve layout, spacing, and accessibility. Add proper labels and helper text.
  - Add primary/secondary button hierarchy and clearer mode switch control.
  - Preserve existing refs (`email`, `password`, `mode`, `isLoading`) and submit behavior.
- Change (minor): `src/App.vue`
  - Ensure the unauthenticated container provides neutral background and centered content; confirm compatibility with Vuetify components.
- Optional (create, only if needed): `src/components/AuthLayout.vue`
  - A small wrapper providing centered layout with `v-container`, `v-row`, and `v-col` for reuse and cleaner `AuthForm` template.

### UI/UX Changes
- Layout
  - Center the form vertically within viewport, constrain width to `max-w-md` equivalent, and use a `v-card` for structure.
  - Add a concise header (e.g., "Welcome back" / "Create your account") and a one-line subtext.
- Inputs
  - Replace raw `<input>` with `v-text-field` for email and password.
  - Add password visibility toggle and client-side required validation messages.
  - Use explicit `label` props rather than placeholder-only.
- Buttons
  - Primary `v-btn` (contained) for submit: "Sign In" or "Create Account" according to mode.
  - Secondary `v-btn` (text/tonal) to toggle between Sign In and Sign Up.
  - Optional tertiary link for "Forgot password?" (non-blocking; can noop or emit for future hook-up).
- Feedback
  - Use `v-alert` for error and info messages with `aria-live="polite"` for screen readers.
  - Disable submit while `isLoading` and show a progress indicator inside the primary button.
- Theming/Polish
  - Respect current Vuetify theme. Avoid custom CSS; rely on Vuetify spacing and utility classes already present.

### Behavior / Logic (unchanged)
- Sign up uses `supabase.auth.signUp({ email, password })` and displays confirmation info message.
- Sign in uses `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password })` and surfaces error messages.
- Maintain `mode` toggling and `isLoading` handling.
- No changes to profile fetching, session state, or navigation in `src/App.vue`.

### Accessibility
- Provide labels on all fields; keep helpful descriptions concise.
- Ensure focus order is logical; focus the first invalid field on submit failure.
- Use `aria-live` regions for error/info feedback.

### Implementation Steps
1. Replace `AuthForm.vue` structure with a `v-card`-based layout. Keep `<script setup>` state as-is.
2. Swap inputs to `v-text-field` with `type="email"` and `type="password"`; add password visibility toggle.
3. Add primary submit `v-btn` (loading state) and secondary toggle `v-btn` for switching modes; include optional "Forgot password?" link (no-op or emitted event for later wiring).
4. Replace inline error/info divs with `v-alert` components using `variant="tonal"` and appropriate `type`.
5. Verify unauthenticated container in `src/App.vue` remains a neutral background and centers content; adjust classes minimally if needed.
6. Build and validate: unauthenticated users see the improved card; form states (loading, error, info) render correctly; mode toggle updates labels and button text.

### Out of Scope
- Adding OAuth providers or password reset flows (can be planned separately).
- Refactoring auth calls into new library functions (keep direct calls for now to minimize scope).
- Routing changes or multi-page auth.
